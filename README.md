This was made during our time as students at Code Chrysalis.  
  
This app offers users an elegant solution to easily work on files saved in their Google Drive while talking to their team members through video chat!  
  
To get started, access the app through the following link:

## If you wish to create a work room
Next, set up the files that you want to work on in your room, and click the Make Room button.  
Finally, click join room, and you'll be taken to your room, where you can begin working on your configured files with your team!

## If you wish to join a pre-existing room
Upon loading into the app, you should see a Join Room button on the right-hand side of the screen. Click that, and you'll be taken to a work room, where you can video chat and work with all other team members currently in the room.
